    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Often called simply "Hakka stir-fry" (or ke jia xiao chao) in Taiwan, where it is popular, this dish is exemplary of Hakka cuisine.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Dried squid can be used in place of fresh. 
        Use 1/4 pound dried squid, found in Asian groceries, soaked in warm water for 30 minutes and sliced along the bodies into long thin strips.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound boneless pork belly</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable, peanut, or canola oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece ginger, peeled and thinly sliced to matchsticks</li>
        <li>1 small carrot, peeled and julienned</li>
        <li>1 cup Chinese celery, cut to 2-inch long pieces (or 1 cup regular celery sliced thinly on a strong bias)</li>
        <li>2 scallions, sliced on a bias into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Asian rice wine</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 pound cleaned squid, tentacles removed and bodies sliced thinly lengthwise into strips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bring a small pot of lightly salted water deep enough to submerge the pork to a boil. Drop in the pork belly and simmer for 20 minutes. 
            Drain and let cool. Once cool enough to handle, slice pork thinly lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices.
        </li>

        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium high heat until shimmering. 
            Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, until sizzling-hot and fragrant, about 10 seconds. 
            Stir in the pork belly and toss briskly for about 1 minute. 
            Stir in the carrot, celery, and scallions and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are just crisp-tender, about 1 minute.
        </li>

        <li>Add the rice wine and soy sauce and cook, stirring, until bubbling, about 30 seconds. 
            Stir the squid and cook, stirring, just until squid turns opaque, about 1 minute. 
            Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and more soy sauce as necessary. Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ul>
