        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Spaghetti Carbonara is named for the coal miner. And yet, there is nothing smoky about the original version—guanciale and pancetta are both unsmoked cuts of pork. 
            So, I used smoked salt and smoked bacon to reinforce the classic pasta’s namesake. I even added a bit of smoked salt to the pasta water, although I couldn’t determine if that made any difference. 
            The result is as luscious and creamy as the original, but with a decidedly winter-in-a-log-cabin meets mountain-backyard American attitude. I love this version.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 zucchini, cut into a very fine julienne (optional; use a julienne peeler)</li>
            <li>2 cups cream</li>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dry white wine (optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li>6 slices bacon, diced</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of water to boil. Season with salt, including 1 tablespoon smoked salt (optional). Cook the spaghetti until just under al dente. 
                Add the zucchini 1 to 2 minutes before the pasta is done, and drain with the pasta (optional).
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large high-sided pan on medium heat. Add the bacon, and cook until crisp. Add the wine, if you want to.
            </li>

            <li>
                Drain the pasta.
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Take the pan off the hot burner, and shut off the heat. Whisk together the eggs and cream and cheeses in a separate bowl, and pour them into the pan. 
                Put over a very low flame, and add the pasta. Season with smoked salt and cracked black pepper. Heat very low until the sauce thickens and coats the pasta.
            </li>

            <li>
                Top with more Parmesan, smoked salt, and the chopped parsley.
            </li>
        </ul>
