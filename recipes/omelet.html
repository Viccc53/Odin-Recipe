    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Much simpler than a classic soufflé, 
        this soufflé omelette is cooked in a skillet on the stovetop 
        and requires little more than eggs, cheese, and a couple of extra minutes to beat the whites.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs, separated</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 ounces (55g) grated Gruyère or cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>Minced fresh chives (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In medium bowl, beat egg yolks with a generous pinch of salt and some freshly ground black pepper until well mixed.
        </li>

        <li>
            In separate large mixing bowl, using a whisk, electric hand blender, or stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, 
            beat egg whites until firm, glossy peaks form.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add half of the beaten egg whites to yolks and stir well until whites are thoroughly combined and soufflé base has a looser consistency. 
            Mix in half the cheese as well as the chives, if using. 
            Add remaining beaten whites, and, using a silicone spatula, gently fold them into the soufflé base just until well combined.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to whip up the Soufflé omelette</h3>
    <p>
        The steps are as follows: First, beat the yolks with a generous pinch of salt. 
        Adding the salt early is important because you don't want to deflate the mixture later while trying to evenly distribute it into the beaten whites. 
        You want to add a little more salt than it might seem like the yolks need, since you'll want enough to also season the whites.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, beat the whites to stiff peaks, which means they won't slump over when lifted with a whisk. Just as with the classic soufflé, 
        I'm a proponent of putting in a little elbow grease to beat the whites by hand. 
        It gives you more control and makes it easy to spot the right moment when the eggs hit that perfect stage of firmness. 
        It's not nearly as strenuous as some people make it out to be. That said, you're free to use a hand mixer or a stand mixer, if you prefer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fold half the whites into the yolks to loosen them. 
        Don't worry too much about deflating this first addition of whites; it's more important to get a well-mixed, loose base.
    </p>

    <h3>Suggested Additions</h3>
    <p>
        This is the point where I'd mix in any flavorings, like herbs or cheese, 
        which I strongly recommend—a plain-egg soufflé omelette is not nearly as tasty as one might imagine. 
        It's as if the incorporated air brings out a kind of raw-egg aroma. 
        (This is something that often bothers me about meringues, too.) Cheese manages to cover that flavor up.
